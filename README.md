### Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I'm currently exploring Flask, Vuejs, Gridsome, Tailwind on my way to fullstack.
- 🕹️ I made a full-fledged arcade video game called [MadLove](https://www.madlove.games/). Since then I switched to Godot and started porting the game for future projects
- 🧐 Always curious to try out new stuff
- 😊 Coming from MS Dynamics NAV I'm really excited to use open source technologies
